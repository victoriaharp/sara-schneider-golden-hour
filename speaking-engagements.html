    <h3 class="font-italiana text-4xl">As a speaker, </h3>
    <p class="font-montserrat">Sara will speak to you in an authentic and inspired way that makes you feel seen, understood, and challenged.
    <br><br>
    Sara speaks from the heart. With courage and vulnerability, she genuinely shares her own unique experiences of pain, suffering, and redemption. Sara has experienced childhood trauma, infertility, failed adoptions, navigated 2 successful adoptions, suffered friends loss, navigated life with a child with mental illness/special needs, and worked through issues of county and educational failure.
    <br><br>
    In addition, Sara subscribes to a life of joy! Her secret sauce is seeking the positive in any situation. Sara will inspire you with real life experiences that will resonate with you. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, and you’ll leave knowing you are not alone and more equipped to handle life's adversity.
