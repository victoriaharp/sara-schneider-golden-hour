- testimony: After our initial conversation where I explained my goals to Sara, she and I worked together on a very clear plan of action for how I would accomplish these goals. She took the time to understand my background, current lifestyle, and where I wanted to be in the future. She came prepared with exercises and tools to help me discover ways that I can accomplish my goals.
